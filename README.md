# Khovratovich's Equihash in C\##

A C# translation of **Dmitry Khovratovich's** original C++11 **Equihash** reference implementation.

See the original version over at his GitHub page: (https://github.com/khovratovich/equihash)

##I have striven not to introduce any optimisations, behaviour changes or fixes into the translated implementation.##
The only exception being that I have had to use a memory mapped file to represent the 3D array 'TupleList'.
